abstract={Distributed Software Development (DSD) is characterized by physical distance and/or different time-zones among those involved in the process of developing software[1]. This paper presents a systematic tertiary study about communication in distributed development that aimed to identify and to synthesize factors that influence the effectiveness of communication in such settings and its effects in the design of such projects.},
