abstract = {Background: Several researchers have reportedtheir experiences in applying secondary studies in  Software Engineering (SE), however, there is a lack of studies discussing thedistinction  between  Systematic  Mappings  (SMs)  and  SystematicLiterature Reviews (SLRs).  Aims: The objective of this  paper isto present the results of a tertiary study conducted to collect andevaluate evidence to better understand similarities and differencesbetween SLRs and SMs related to four aspects: research question,search  string,  search  strategy  and  quality  assessment.  Method: We   identified 170 secondary   studies   that   were   reviewed   toanswer a set of Research Questions (RQ) related to the practicalconduction of secondary studies in SE. Results: Results show thatboth  SLRs  and  SMs  have  generic  RQs,  broad  search  strings,and adopt automatic search as search strategy. However, qualityassessment has been more widely adopted in SLRs. Conclusions: In  practice,  only  the  quality  assessment  is  conducted  differentlyin  SLRs  and  SMs.},
