abstract = {Software organizations need to increase their productivity to stay competitive. Although there is a lot of research on productivity in software development, software organizations still do not know what are the most significant productivity factors in which they should invest. This paper presents a Tertiary Literature Review (TLR) that aims to identify and analyze Systematic Literature Reviews (SLR) on the influence factors of software productivity reported in the scientific literature. We extracted and classified the influence factors into organizational factors (organizational-dependent factors) and human factors (people-dependent factors). The relevance of the factors was extracted according to the amount of references found in the secondary studies. Using this information, software organizations can improve the productivity of their projects by evaluating the influence factors that best fit their context.},
